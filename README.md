# Servers
Practicing Node and Express servers from various soruces. Each branch is a different tutorial. Notice, I have used names of different butlers and housekeepers (i.e SERVERS) as the branch names. That shit is clever, dog. Don't front on the boy.

## `Alfred`

## `Belvedere`
Basic server that uses FS and HTTP modules to serve basic HTTP pages. Very barebones NodeJS server with ony two modules included.

* FS
* HTTP

## `Cinderella`
Create a folder called bars_and_bats as the root folder for this project.  Within this folder, create:

* app.js - node server.
* folder called views - HTML files
* folder called images - images
* folder called stylesheets - CSS files

Your server handles the following URL requests:
* localhost:7077/bars - HTML page about bars, with pictures stored in images folder
* localhost:7077/cars - HTML page with some cool pictures of cars
* localhost:7077/cars/new - HTML page with a form where the user can add a new car information

The point of this exercise is to build a NodeJS server that serves all types of content
